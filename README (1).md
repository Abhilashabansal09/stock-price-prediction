# 📈 Netflix Stock Price Prediction

Predicting **Netflix (NFLX)** stock closing prices using Machine Learning models with full EDA, visualizations, and evaluation.

---

## 📚 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Netflix stock prices using different regression models:  
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

We explored the data, visualized trends, created moving averages, built models, evaluated their performance, and visualized predictions.
